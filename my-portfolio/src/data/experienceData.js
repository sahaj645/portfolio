      "During my internship at DRDO, I explored AI-adapted time ensembles as a novel alternative to traditional methods like the Kalman Filter and Three-Cornered Hat for atomic timekeeping. I developed models capable of learning non-linear drift patterns and dynamically adjusting to changing noise conditions, improving reliability in GPS-denied and defense-critical environments. By incorporating external factors such as temperature variations and oscillator behavior, the system achieved greater context-aware synchronization. In a 30-day GPS-synced simulation, this approach reduced Allan deviation by up to 71% compared to existing techniques, demonstrating its potential to redefine precision timing",

      "I developed a Cause List Simplifier for a law firm to streamline daily case listings issued by the Jaipur High Court. The original Cause Lists were published in a cluttered and unstructured format, making it time-consuming for legal professionals to extract relevant case information. My solution parsed and transformed this data into a clean, organized format, significantly improving readability and efficiency for the firm's daily workflow.",
